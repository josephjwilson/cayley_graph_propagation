"""
Rewiring module for graph transformation algorithms.

This package provides implementations of various graph rewiring strategies that
can be used to enhance message passing in graph neural networks. The rewiring
algorithms modify the connectivity structure of the input graph while preserving
key properties.

Currently supported rewiring methods:
- Cayley graph-based expander structures (EGP and CGP)
- Fully adjacent (complete graph) rewiring
